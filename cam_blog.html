  <p> Pure, aesthetically pleasing and white. Whiter than white. The most white that you'll ever see in artistic form of expression.
    And no we're not talking about minimalism as a form of living even though you could probably make art with that somehow.
    Like the idea of the essential and rejecting everything that is not neccessary to everyday living and creating...that's art yo.
    <b>EVERYTHING IS ART!!!!!</b>
